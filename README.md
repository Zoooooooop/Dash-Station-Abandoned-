Sorry if it's hard to read. I'm fighting Github's formatting system.

# Dash-Station-Abandoned-By Creator
Space Station 13 map created in Strong DMM.

If you wish to finish or use any part of this map then you may do so only if you follow these three rules

Rule 1# - The Chaple must contain a highly visible cross (An example cross was placed down by engineering)

Rule 2# - The Chaple must contain a paper with "John 3:16 - For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." written on it. The paper should be made public in the chaple.

Rule 3# - You may NOT celebrate other religions in the chaple. This rule isn't for the players within a server. This rule is for the map itself and editing it.

**Curent map design philosophy**

Note - This and further sections are **NOT** rules. This is just some concepts of creating that map that I was following. Further sections contain more info.

The idea of this station was to be a brand new state of the art research facility.
Because of this reason there wouldn't be much dirt or messes on the station as it's brand new.
This station can be placed either in space or be used on a jungle planet.

(A) The map contains a large defining hallway down the center of it

  (1) This larger hallway was done as an experiment that seems to have worked. I was tired of the small hallways in most stations.
  
  (2) The main hallway is barren as it is incomplete
  
  (3) Departures is set to be in the right most portion of the map and arrivals in the left mostz
  
(B) Smaller hallways branch off from the main hallway into the other hallways

  (1) These hallways lead into public areas or into lobbies of other departments
  
     a1 A great example would be the engineering or service area
    
  (2) These branching hallways would also offer a way to travel in the event of the main being destroyed for any reason
  
(C) Room sizes

  (1) Most rooms on the station should serve a purpose
  
  (2) Most rooms should have more than enough space to walk around in.
  
  (3) Don't fill a normal roomm with garbage. Only nessesities. Empty tables are fine.
  
  (4) This was all done because I hated how cluttered and disorganized most maps were. Also, since I love construction and repurposing rooms as a player, having such small cluttered rooms really hurt my ability to do this.
  
(D) Various

  (1) All departments recieved a double door airlock system (This is because of you, grey tiders)
  
  (2) All departments should have several exits into maintanance
  
    a1 This objective wasn't completed as departments were not yet set in stone. I would have done this in another pass through the map at some later time
    
  (3) If you have to cram something somewhere it's probably a bad design.
  
(F) Maintanence

  (1) Maintanence hasn't been worked much
  
  (2) There was going to be some sort of walkway around the station of a straight maintanence path. It was going to be used as mostly a meteor shield and to get around departments.
  
  (3) Maint's should be big enough to serve as a place to hide and get lost in, but not big enough you'll never see someone again.
  
  (4) There is a well maintained hall with cameras leading up to the outer maint tunnel.
  
  (5) Some departments may contain tiny rooms with maintanence tiles. There should be ladders there but I never placed them.
  
(G) Departments that are pulled backa  bit from the main hallway to support other rooms like dorms.

  Lastly I wanted to bring up the fact that departments may seem uber compressed.
  To some extent this is true but I left spaces between all departments for maint access.
  
**Curent map features**

1. Art has been randomly placed around the station. Players can place more art than ever before and enjoy it more.
2. Bushes because they are awesome.
3. Various posters and floor decals to warn about possible dangers. Dangers include blast doors or shutters, incenerator irradiation radius and areas with turrets.
4. Cargo has both a lobby and a room to store orders and deliveries in (If this wasn't obvious)
5. Cargo now actually has a decent sized bay
6. Cargo also has two **WELL LIT** and **CLEAN** warehouses
7. Atmospherics has a play room and the main air supply loop. Gas storage is on another Z level with no access yet
8. Engineering has a "RP" panic bunker as their secure storage.
9. Singulo on another station level, with a grand father clock.
10. Security has a split armory design. Lethals in one area and non lethal in another. Just in case the warden wants to let officers into less than lethal gear.
11. Security has some heavy weapons (This was going to be a test. To see if they are actually OP or if they can use them balancedly)
12. Security also has a surplus rifle armory, fit to give arms to the entire station.
13. Simple medical bay?
14. Random laser tag turrts that shoot you if your on the enemy team.
15. A dead man in the incenerator

  **Issues**

1. The medical bay is exceptionally close to the main hallway. It needs pulled back to at least engineering's depth. It needs 
2. Incenerator room might be *too* dirty
3. Incenerator room is to close to a work area (Even though I'm sure the techs will irradiate it to)
4. Atmospherics has no way to access it's storage
5. Atmospherics feels very weird with gas storage being a floor below
6. Science may need a new layout to include an enterance at the side
7. The entire AI sattleite doesn't have a location that fits with it's shape. (I was going to bridge to it but then they would need rotated... and thats a lot of work)

**Major Issue**

Alright listen, this is the reason there are two map files. 
Version 7 (V7) seems to have some sort of error associated with loading the map. 
I can't solve this issue but it contains my latest changes.
If you can figure out to load it then great. I was fixing the medical issue when it decided to stop working. If not, there is version 3 available.

**Bye Bye for now**

Thank you to Jesus Christ for saving me and giving me rest. Without him this map would have never been created to even this point. I may have even commited suicide.
