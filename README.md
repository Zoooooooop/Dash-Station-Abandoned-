If you want to finish or complete this map then you are allowed to if you follow these rules
Rule 1# - The Chaple must contain a highly visible cross (An example cross was placed down by engineering)
Rule 2# - The Chaple must contain a paper with "John 3:16 - For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." written on it. The paper should be made public in the chaple.
Rule 3# - You may NOT celebrate other religions in the chaple. This rule isn't for the players within a server. This rule is for editing the map only.

**Explanation on design choices taken in the map. Also on what was currently done**

**Curent features of the map and design philosophy**

The idea of this station was to be a brand new state of the art research facility.
Because of this reason there wouldn't be much dirt or messes on the station as it's brand new.
This station can be placed either in space or be used on a jungle planet.

(1) The map contains a large defining hallway down the center of it

  (A) This larger hallway was done as an experiment that seems to have worked. I was tired of the small hallways in most stations.
  
  (B) The main hallway is barren as it is incomplete
  
  (C) Departures is set to be in the right most portion of the map and arrivals in the left most
  
(2) Smaller hallways branch off from the main hallway into the other hallways.

  (A) These hallways lead into public areas or into lobbies of other departments
  
    (a1) A great example would be the engineering or service area
  (B) These branching hallways would also offer a way to travel in the event of the main being destroyed for any reason
(3) Room sizes
  (A) Most rooms on the station should serve a purpose
  (B) Most rooms should have more than enough space to walk around in.
  (C)
    (a1) There should be more than enough space to walk and do your work in. Every part of the station shouldn't feel cramped.
